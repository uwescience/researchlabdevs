Summary: Review of past meetings

Greetings! The group has now been live for a few months, and I thought I'd give an overview of meetings we have had so far. The mailing list went live in May of this year, and we had our first get-together in June. It was a fun time; we met at the Big Time and spent a couple of hours just hanging out and getting to know each other. We skipped July, and then started to get slightly more organized in August:

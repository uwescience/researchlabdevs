Title: UW Research Lab Devs

Welcome! We are a group of developers in research labs at the UW!

Our goal is to support each other and learn together. Being a software developer in a research lab can be a lonely existence, since there are often no other software developers around. Sure, other people in the lab often write code, but by definition we are generally the senior software developers, since it is usually our primary job, whereas others in the labs are writing code as a part of their job, not their primary purpose. This means it is often hard to find mentors and peers to ask questions of and share notes with. This group is meant to help fill that void. We are interested in software development best practices, the intersection of science and software, and career development. Although we are primarily software developers, we welcome scientists who want to become better developers as well!

We have meetings on campus at least once a month, and we have a mailing list. We announce meetings and other events of interest on the mailing list, as well as talking shop and giving/getting advice. Please sign up for our mailing list [here](https://mailman1.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/research_lab_devs).

We are looking for people to present for upcoming meetings, so if you have something to share, please contact Maria McKinley, &#112;&#97;&#114;&#111;&#100;&#121;&#64;&#117;&#119;&#46;&#101;&#100;&#117;
